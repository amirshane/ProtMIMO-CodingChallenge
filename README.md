# ProtMIMO-CodingChallenge

This is a machine learning (for proteins) coding challenge.  It aims to assess general modeling skills as well as paper reading/implementation skills. It is intended to be done in PyTorch. 

The specific task is to use the Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) architecture from [Havasi et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06610) for protein function prediction. Some boilerplate code is provided especially for downloading and processing the GFP (fluorescence) data from [Tasks Assessing Protein Embeddings (Tape)](https://github.com/songlab-cal/tape).
